# 101Spins

A responsive landing page for a sweepstakes casino affiliate brand inspired by modern iGaming destinations like sweepskings.com. The site highlights top offers, player reviews, educational resources, and a newsletter sign-up.

## Getting started

The project is built with static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScriptâ€”no build tools required.

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the experience.
2. Update content in the HTML file to feature current promotions or casino partners.
3. Customize colors and layout through `assets/css/styles.css`.

## Features

- Sticky navigation with mobile-friendly menu toggle.
- Hero section with featured offer and performance stats.
- Responsive grids for top casino offers, player reviews, insights, and FAQs.
- Accessible call-to-actions and newsletter form with inline confirmation messaging.
- Lightweight SVG logo placeholders that can be replaced with partner assets.

## Customization tips

- Swap SVG placeholders in `assets/img/` with your brand logos.
- Update FAQ entries and insight listings directly in `index.html`.
- Extend `assets/js/main.js` to connect the newsletter form to your preferred email platform.

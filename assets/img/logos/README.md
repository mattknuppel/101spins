# Casino logos

Place the official casino logo assets for the Top Offers section in this directory using the filenames referenced in `index.html` (for example `logo-lonestar.webp`).

The project expects WebP files sized for a 72px square container. Replace the bundled SVG placeholders with the licensed artwork supplied by each casino before deploying.

If a WebP asset is unavailable or fails to load, the corresponding `<img>` tag automatically falls back to the SVG placeholder (for example `logo-lonestar.svg`) so the layout remains presentable in default checkouts.
